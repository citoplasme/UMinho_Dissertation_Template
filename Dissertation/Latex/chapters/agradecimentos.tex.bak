\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Carlos Silva, my supervisor, for the dedication and guidance provided throughout this year. Most of all, I am thankful for never giving up and always pushing through the challenges this research offered. This work would certainly not be as successful if it was not for his motivation and ambition.

To Adriano, with whom I had the pleasure of working during his PhD's thesis, I cannot thank you enough for the help and support, as well as the counseling given when I was feeling somewhat lost.

A special thanks goes to my partner in crime during the two years of my Master's degree, Patrícia, with whom I shared a roller-coaster of many highs and lows and many working hours. Without you this adventure would not have been as fun.

To Alexandra, Sofia and Eduarda, words cannot describe how grateful I am for all the support and for sharing these five amazing years by your side. It was a privilege to walk this road with you three and make some of the best memories, which shall never be forgotten. 

To João, I'm eternally grateful for always being there for me, listening to my problems and helping me the best way you could. Thank you for making every day a little bit better than the last one and for being my safe harbor when I needed to escape from reality. Without your support I would not have been able to push through these last years, especially the year we met.

I would like to thank Pinto as well, for all the support given and for making me believe that friendships can last long if you devote yourself to it, even when we follow different paths and are miles apart. 

To the friends I made in the lab, thank you for all the good moments and for not only making this space a great workspace, but also for creating such a good and friendly environment.

Many thanks to my second family, the \emph{Incríveis}, who always supported me and with whom I created great memories since my first year of college.

Lastly, but not least, I'm forever grateful to my parents and brother, without whom I could not have surpassed this big stage in my life. Thank you for all the unconditional love and support, for never letting me give up and for giving me the chance to graduate. My success is yours as well.
